# ToDoList-Version2
This is a ToDo Website created using Node & EJS as backend and MongoDB database and Mongoose (Dynamic database using MongoDB Atlas).

# Mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It provides a higher-level abstraction layer over the MongoDB driver and simplifies the interactions with MongoDB by allowing developers to use a schema-based approach for data modeling and validation.
